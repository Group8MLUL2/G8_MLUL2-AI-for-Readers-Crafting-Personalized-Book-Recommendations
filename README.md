# AI for Readers: Crafting Personalized Book Recommendations

## Project Statement
Recommendation systems are essential in machine learning, enabling businesses to deliver personalized content to users, driving engagement and revenue. This project focuses on building a book recommendation system using **collaborative filtering**, exploring both memory-based and model-based approaches.

## Key Features

### 1. Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique that identifies patterns in user-item interactions to offer tailored recommendations. It relies on usersâ€™ past behaviors or ratings, without depending on item-specific features like author or genre.

### 2. Techniques Used
- **Memory-Based Approaches**  
  This method calculates similarity scores between users or items. It is computationally simpler and works well for smaller datasets.
  
- **Model-Based Approaches**  
  These methods predict user preferences using models like matrix factorization or neural networks. Model-based approaches ensure scalability for larger datasets.

### 3. Advanced Methods
- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**  
  NMF decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to extract latent features, improving recommendation accuracy.
  
- **Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., t-SNE)**  
  Reduces data complexity while maintaining the important patterns in user-item interactions, making it easier to visualize high-dimensional data.
  
- **Clustering-Based Approaches**  
  Grouping similar users or items can refine recommendations by focusing on highly related groups.

## Objective
By integrating these advanced techniques, the project aims to develop a highly efficient and personalized book recommendation system. The goal is to improve recommendation precision and user satisfaction by providing relevant book suggestions based on individual preferences.

## Demo

An interactive demo of the book recommendation system is available through **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**. The demo showcases the following:

- **FastAPI**: Used for backend API to handle recommendation requests and serve personalized results based on user inputs.
- **Streamlit**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the recommendation system, allowing them to input their preferences and view personalized book recommendations.

To explore the demo, follow the instructions below.

### Running the Demo Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/book-recommendation-system.git
   cd book-recommendation-system
